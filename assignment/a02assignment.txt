program 1.


build  a calculator program for adding, subtracting
and division, think what all could be the basics
you need to put in the design.


For all the below assinments 
make use of the 
a01codesample.cpp.


program 2 

create a class called TheromoStat with
the following inforamtion.

    double currentTemperature;
    double desiredTemperature;
    bool heatingOn;
    bool coolingOn;

provide appropriate functions.


provide options for the following.

Create a menu as follows.

0. Initialize the Theromostat. 
1. change Temparature.
2. change heating on/off
3. change collingOn/off
0. Exit

Program 3.

Create a class called HVACSystem which has a thermostat,
venitallator system, airconditoiner and thermostat inside
it and provide a menu as follows.


1. Activate the hvac system, set the therostat, ac and VentilationSystem sytem 
with some defaults.
2. show status of system.
show the current values associated with theromstat, VentilationSystem
and airconditioner.
3. change 
0. Exit

when change option show a further menu as 
Change 

1. airconditioner.
2. thermostat
3. VentilationSystem
show the existing values for the selected system
and ask for new values change it and return back to the
earlier menu.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Day 2


Program 4

1. use or create the class HVACSystem, add an inforamtion
called deviceId and location which are of type int,
and string provide appropriate methods. content
of HVACSystem will be .

1. deviceId
2. location
3. TheromoStat
4. AirConditioner
5. VentilationSystem 

and their  apropriate methods.


2. in some other class or function, create the 
function which has 5 element array of HVACSystem
fill up some random values for the deviceId
location, thermostat, airconditioner and ventillation systems.

3. show a menu as follows.

1. view the details of hvac system.
2. update the details of the hvac system.
3. view all devices based  on location.
4. exit

when option 1 is selected print all the details
of hvac ssytem including deviceid, location,
thermostat inforation, Airconditioner inforamtion,
ventillationsystem information.. after asking deviceid

when option 2 is selected ask for deviceid
and locate the particular hvac system and ask for
what to update.

1. hvac system info
2. thermostat
3. airconditioner.
4. ventillation system.

based on the input, ask for necessaryinformation about
the particular for example if person selects hvac system
ask for new location and change only location.

if for thermostat, ask for 
currentTemperature;
     desiredTemperature;
    heatingOn;
    coolingOn;

similarly for other entities.

option 3.
when user is telling 3, ask for location
and show entire hvac details in that location.

option 4.
exit the program.

----------------------------------------------------------------

program 5

create a class called ThermoStat and allocate
memory for currentTemperature;
     desiredTemperature in a dynamic way
     and demonstrate need for copy constructor
destructor and overloaded assingment operator.

------------------------------------------------------------

program 6.
overload the > and < and == operator in VentilationSystem
system and show that we can compare two VentilationSystem
objects for >,< and  ==.

---------------------------------------------------------------

program 7

0. day02\a39constexpr.cpp see whether this program works.
and measure time with constexpr..

2. copy constexpr examples in the code. and look
for codebase...
