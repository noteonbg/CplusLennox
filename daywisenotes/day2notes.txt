What are the best practices for defining a function or method: within a class or outside of it


1. we are in c++, use functions of the class only if
you feel 
1.1 you are creating a data type.
1.2 you feel logically that function belongs to the class.

in all other cases.
just create a namespace and dump the function inside it.




namespace x
f1

.h
.cpp

multiple .h
multiple .cpp files
corresponding to namespace  answer is yes..







create a data type hvac system.


hvac system

content
	 thermostat
	 ac
	 ventilator system.

operations
      activate  hvac system.
      show status
      changethehvacsystem(int category)
 	

namespace ui
{

show UI options aand getoption  --x
whatcategorytochange  --y
anotherfunction take x and y do the job  -- i call havac sysem
ui functions
show menu
option 1, option 2...


}

how to recognize a kid programmer.
global things will be there.

I think it is always better to call the function and then define it
than define the function and think where to call it.


S  --single responsibility moral science principle
O  -  open closed principle we should know interfaces..
